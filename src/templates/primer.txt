<!-- Note: you can turn on/off word wrap in this text area by clicking the checkbox below. Also, any text you see between less than and greater than marks, that's HTML. You don't have to use/know HTML to write a QnA, but it can be useful. For example, this text doesn't show up in the word bubbles because it's a HTML comment. -->

Q(1): Would you like to write an interactive QnA?
A: Yes.
	Q(1.1): Are you viewing this exchange in a window with the same text in two places, a text area on the left and blue and gray word bubbles on the right?
	A: Yes.
		Q(1.1.1): Cool. The text on the left, coupled with user interaction, defines what how the bubbles are presented. Do you want to learn more?
		A: Yes.
			Q(1.1.1.1): The text on the left is just a set of nested text blocks. The blocks start with either a "Q:" or an "A:". I know, I know...  you see parentheses with numbers after the letters and before the colons, but you can leave these out.* They're added automatically by the editor when you click "Update Outputs" to help you know where things are.
			A: What's the asterisk for?
				Q(1.1.1.1.1): Well, sometimes you do need the numbers, like when you want to use a GOTO call. 
				A: What's that?
					Q(1.1.1.1.1.1): You can place a GOTO call at the end of a question (a block starting with Q) and it will jump to where you point it. Want to give it a try?
					A: Yes. Again, again! 
						Q(1.1.1.1.1.1.1):GOTO:1.1.1.1.1
					A: No. Let's move on.
						Q(myname): Instead of pre-defined answers/choices, you can also ask the viewer to enter text of their own. For example, what's your name?
						X:
							Q(1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1): Pleased to meet you <x>myname</x>. See what I did there? You can do more, but now you know the basics. For example, you can split a bubble in two. <br><br> You can do a lot with with just: Q GOTO A and X. <br><br> Do you want me to open a window a detailed descriptions of what you can do?
							A:[http://www.qnamarkup.org/syntax/] Yes.
								Q(1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1): Feel free to edit what you see in the text field or start from scratch. To see what your markup come to life, hit the "Update Outputs" button below the text area. GOTO:2
							A: No.
								Q(1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.2):GOTO:1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1
		A: No.
			Q(1.1.1.2):GOTO:2
	A: No.
		Q(1.1.2): Then head over to <a href="http://www.qnamarkup.org">http://www.QnAMarkup.org</a>.
A: No. 
	Q(1.2): Okay then. GOTO:2

Q(2): Have a nice day.
